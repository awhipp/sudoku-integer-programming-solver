# Solving Sudoku Boards through Integer Programming
## OR541 Term Project by: Alexander Whipp and Julie Carey

This project leverages integer programming to dynamically solve ANY NxN Sudoku board (so long as it is a viable board). Typically this means that N is a perfect square.

Tested on thousands of generated boards in the following formats:
* 4x4
* 9x9
* 16x16
